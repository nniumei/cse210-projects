# cse210-student-template
This is for students in CSE 210.
And it took waaaaaaaay longer to figure this out than it should have.
It was pretty funny.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
